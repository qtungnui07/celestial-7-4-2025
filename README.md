5. Create a folder named "random" anywhere in the Documents directory, and move the file "randomdom.jar" into that folder.
6. Create a shortcut, sel "randomdom.jar", Next and rename for this shortcut if u want then Finish.

7. Open Properties of this shortcut and follow me

------------- Put this to the 'Target' directory -------------

"C:\Program Files\Java\graalvm-jdk-21.0.6+8.1\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "C:\Users\ "name" \Documents\random\randomdom.jar"

------------- "Start in" -------------

C:\Users\ "username" \Documents\random

so done, u can launch it normally :3 

ah
u can add "LP.jar" to "JA" like this

have fun!
